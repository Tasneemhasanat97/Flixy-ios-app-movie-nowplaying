# Flixy

#### Flixy is an app that allows users to browse movies from the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).
#### This app is created on Swift platform for ios mobile development on xcode. 
#### This is the first project from CodePath's ios University course, utilizing UI elements in ios development such as TableView, Cell Recycling & Networking with APIs
#### New software features such as ViewController and Storyboard were implimented for the development of the application.
#### Added a dark mode theme to the entire application including the launch screen 
#### Dark mode implementation done via customizing story-boards
#### Plans on later adding a dark-mode button to project so user/client can switch in between dark and light modes

### Notes
